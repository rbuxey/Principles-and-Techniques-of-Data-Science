This project involves creating a classifier that distinguishes spam emails from non spam emails.

Through this project, I became comfortable with the following:

- Feature engineering with text data
- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
