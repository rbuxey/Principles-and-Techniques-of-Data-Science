    "Examine the `invalid_zip_bus` dataframe we computed above and look at the businesses that DO NOT have the special MISSING ZIP code value.  Some of the invalid postal codes are just the full 9 digit code rather than the first 5 digits.  Create a new column named `postal5` in the original `bus` dataframe which contains only the first 5 digits of the `postal_code` column.   Finally, for any of the `postal5` ZIP code entries that were not a valid San Fransisco ZIP Code (according to `valid_zips`) set the entry to `None`.  \n",

    "_The immediate thing I notice is the general upward slope of the graph, indicating that more restaurants recieve higher scores than not. There is also a higher concentration between the scores of 70 and 90, after which it becomes more spread out. This indicates that, the higher the score, the more restaurants receive these scores BUT these higher scores aren't represented as often. This could be for a number of reasons, perhaps a nuance in the grading criteria that doesn't allow for partial points as scores get higher._\n",

    "_I also noticed the left tail, where scores are lower. I do think it's unexpected that this doesn't resemble a normal distribution, so that the  highest concentration would be between 70 and 85.

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

This balanced distribution indicates that most businesses had the same score or around the same score in both inspections, or that the score increased/decreased the same amount. Essentially, it does not indicate that the restaurant's scores increased from the first to the second inspection._"

    "_If a restaurant's score improves from the first to second inspection, it would be reflected in the histogram with the center being greater than 0 and the graph would be heavily skewed to the right to indicate the difference is positive. The spread of the graph would be relatively equal skewed to the right, indicating more restaurants have a positive diference. Instead, however, the histogram is centered around -2 and is skewed to the left rather than right. This indicates that, in fact, scores were worse from the first to the second inspection. This could be for various reasons, perhaps the inspectors are less lenient when issues aren't dealt with after the first inspection, although I personally expected that restaurants would attempt to address any issues from their first inspection in order to gain a better score and attract more business._"

    "To wrap up our analysis of the restaurant ratings over time, one final metric we will be looking at is the distribution of restaurant scores over time. Create a side-by-side boxplot that shows the distribution of these scores for each different risk category from 2017 to 2019. Use a figure size of at least 12 by 8.\n",

    "- **Unsatisfactory** (0 points): No chart is created, or a chart with completely wrong results.\n",
