This project involved investigating restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco.

It mostly focused on the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through this project, I gained practice with:

- Reading simple csv files and using Pandas
- Working with data at different levels of granularity
- Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
- Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables
